## Summary

Brief explanation of the feature or change being proposed.

## Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

## Detailed Design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with PromptPack to understand, and for somebody familiar with the implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the feature is used.

## Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? Please consider:
- Implementation cost, both in term of code size and complexity
- Whether the proposed feature can be implemented in user space
- The impact on teaching people PromptPack
- Integration of this feature with other existing and planned features

## Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

## Adoption Strategy

If we implement this proposal, how will existing PromptPack users adopt it? Is this a breaking change? Can we write a codemod? Should we coordinate with other projects in the ecosystem?

## Unresolved Questions

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still TBD?
