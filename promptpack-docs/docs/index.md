# PromptPack Specification

**Status:** Draft v1

PromptPack defines a standard way to describe prompts, tools, workflows, and personas â€” enabling consistent behavior across LLM runtimes and agent frameworks.

## What is PromptPack?

PromptPack is an open specification for packaging, testing, and running multi-prompt conversational systems. It provides a standardized format for describing:

- **Prompts** - Individual prompt templates with variables and metadata
- **Tools** - External functions and APIs that can be called by AI systems  
- **Workflows** - Multi-step conversational flows and decision trees
- **Personas** - Character definitions and behavioral guidelines
- **Fragments** - Reusable prompt components and templates

## Why PromptPack?

- **Interoperability** - Works across different LLM providers and frameworks
- **Reusability** - Share and reuse prompt components across projects
- **Testing** - Built-in support for prompt testing and validation
- **Versioning** - Semantic versioning for prompt evolution
- **Governance** - Clear processes for specification development
